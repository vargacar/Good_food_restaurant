# Good_food_restaurant
Project 2 

AS A hungry customer of the Good Food restaurant
I WANT to see their menu and order food on their website
SO THAT I can order easily, save my orders, and write reviews


WHEN I go to the Good Food website
THEN I see a user-friendly interface with a menu for food ordering.

WHEN I log in to my account
THEN the system authenticates their username and password

WHEN I select my account on the menu
THEN I can see my saved orders and reviews, as well as have the option to edit or delete them

WHEN I go to the menu 
THEN I see various categories such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, desserts, and drinks

WHEN I click on a category
THEN I see detailed descriptions of each item with its price and can add it too my order

WHEN I select an item 
THEN I can select options like toppings, sides, and preferred cooking preferences before adding it to my order

WHEN I am done selecting the items in my order
THEN I can select an option to review my order with a sum total and then finalize it

WHEN I finalize my order
THEN the system offers a secure and convenient payment process

WHEN my order is complete and paid
THEN I should receive a confirmation message confirming that the payment was recieved

WHEN my order is confirmed
THEN a user can rate their experience and provide comments if they are logged in

WHEN my order is confirmed
THEN my order is saved to my account as well as the review I may have wrote
