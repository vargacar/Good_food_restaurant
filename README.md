THEN I see a user-friendly interface with a menu for food ordering.

WHEN I log in to my account
THEN the system authenticates their username and password

WHEN I select my account on the menu
THEN I can see my saved orders and reviews, as well as have the option to edit or delete them

WHEN I go to the menu 
THEN I see various categories such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, desserts, and drinks

WHEN I click on a category
THEN I see detailed descriptions of each item with its price and can add it too my order

WHEN I select an item 
THEN I can select options like toppings, sides, and preferred cooking preferences before adding it to my order
